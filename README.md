# edgar-request-summary

Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) is a system to retrieve financial documents.

In this project, I take existing publicly available EDGAR weblogs and assume that each line represents a single web request for an EDGAR document that would be streamed into this program in real time.

Using the data, identify when a user visits, calculate the duration of and number of documents requested during that visit, and then write the output to a file.
